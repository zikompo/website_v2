# Take the Leap of Faith

*March 24, 2025*

Starting a startup is like standing at the edge of a cliff, knowing you need to jump but not being able to see the bottom. It's terrifying and exhilarating at the same time.

## The Project Graveyard

Before taking this leap, I had accumulated quite a collection of side projects. Some were brilliant ideas that I never finished. Others were finished products that never found their audience. Each one taught me something valuable, but they also created a pattern of starting and stopping that I needed to break.

The truth is, **most projects fail**. Not because the ideas are bad, but because we give up too early or we never commit fully to making them work.

## The Moment of Truth

There comes a moment in every entrepreneur's journey where you have to make a choice:

1. Keep building side projects while maintaining the safety of a regular job
2. Take the leap and commit everything to making one thing work

I chose the leap.

## What I've Learned

The biggest difference between a side project and a startup isn't the idea—it's the commitment. When you have nothing to fall back on, you find solutions you never would have discovered otherwise.

Starting a company forces you to confront every fear you have about failure, about not being good enough, about whether your ideas have value. But it also shows you what you're truly capable of when you have no other choice but to succeed.

## The Journey Continues

This is just the beginning. The leap of faith isn't a one-time decision—it's something you have to choose every day. Every morning, you wake up and decide to keep building, keep believing, keep pushing forward despite the uncertainty.

And that's what makes it an adventure worth taking.
