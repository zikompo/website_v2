# Daily Drivers

_Living Document_

These are the things that I use on a daily basis. This is a living document that I will update as I discover new tools or services.

## Devices

**Macbook Pro** - M4 Max, 36GB RAM, 1TB SSD, 14-inch, Space Black.<br />
My main machine. Specs are 100% overkill but it's going to be my machine for the foreseeable future. It runs everything I need perfectly, battery life is great (although M4 Max uses more power than I'd like) and the size is perfect for me. All in all an amazing machine. I currently use this [Dbrand](https://dbrand.com/shop/skins/macbook-pro-14-2024-m4-skins#/customizer/details) skin on it.

**iPhone 17 Pro Max** - 256GB, Silver.<br />
Great phone. Amazing battery life, great screen, great cameras. Just a great phone overall. I currently rock the [Apple](https://www.apple.com/ca/shop/product/mgf84zm/a/iphone-17-pro-max-techwoven-case-with-magsafe-black) case.

**iPad Pro** - M1, 128GB, 11-inch, Space Grey.<br />
Really good for school. Use it mainly for my math and stats courses, and annotating slides. It's pretty neat for signing documents too.

**Sony WH-1000XM6** - Black<br />
Can't go to school without these. Amazing noise cancelling, great sound quality, customizable EQ, and the transparency mode is also very good. Only thing issue is that the surface is prone to fingerprints and smudges.

**Kobo Clara Colour** <br />
My ereader. It is so convenient for reading on the go. Battery life lasts for weeks, screen is easy on the eyes, and it has a built in dictionary that I find very useful for searching up unfamiliar words I encounter in books. I can also sideload books onto the device easily.

## Development

**Cursor** - Code editor.<br />
My default code editor. The tab completions are second to none.

**Visual Studio Code** - Secondary code editor.<br />
I use this mainly for school, because I don't want to vibe code my coding assignments!

**Claude Code** - IDE extension.<br />
When I want to vibe code. Claude Code stands head and shoulders above the rest of its competition, in my opinion.

**Github Desktop** - Version control<br />
I prefer using this to the CLI.

## Essential Apps

**Google Chrome**<br />
Used to use Arc, but the Browser Company stopped adding new features and it became really buggy as of late. Tried switching to Safari but it doesn't support a lot of extensions that I use on a daily basis.

**Alfred**<br />
Great Spotlight replacement. Great file and application search. I tried Raycast, but it's a bit too much for my use case, and I prefer the simplicity of Alfred.

**Things** - Todo list<br />
It costs a pretty penny, but works for my use case.

**Apple Notes App**<br />
Probably my favourite app from Apple. Great versatility.

**Google Calendar**<br />
Put basically everything here. My office hours, appointments, meetings, intramural games, everything. Great for me because I'm quite forgetful when it comes to events.

**iTerm2** - Terminal<br />
I like it over the native Mac terminal.

## Clothing

**Uniqlo** - Shirts, Hoodies<br />
Most of the time, I'm wearing either a shirt or a hoodie from Uniqlo. Great quality at a fair price.

**Zara** - Jeans<br />
Zara has some great jeans. I buy most of my jeans from them.

**Nike Puffer**<br />
For winter.

**North Face Puffer**<br />
For winter.

## Shoes

**New Balance 740**

**Adidas Sambas**

**Nike Dunks**

**Nike Air Force 1** - White<br />
I have two pairs, so I don't wear as often as they are seriously worn out.

## Wishlist

These are things I wish to buy in the near future to add to my daily rotation.

**White shoes**<br />
To replace my worn out AF1s.

**Leather Jacket**<br />
I think I'd look good in one, but they are real _expensive_.

**New Backpack**<br />
My current one is worn out.
