# Building in Public

*March 18, 2025*

Building in public has become more than just a trend—it's a fundamental shift in how we approach creating products and companies. The old model of working in stealth until you have something "perfect" is giving way to a more transparent, community-driven approach.

## Why Transparency Matters

When you build in public, you're not just creating a product; you're building an audience that's invested in your journey. This creates several advantages:

- **Real-time feedback**: Your community helps you course-correct before you go too far down the wrong path
- **Built-in marketing**: People who follow your journey become your first customers and advocates
- **Accountability**: Public commitment creates pressure to keep moving forward

## The Fear Factor

The biggest barrier to building in public isn't technical—it's psychological. We fear:

1. **Judgment**: What if people think our ideas are stupid?
2. **Competition**: What if someone steals our idea?
3. **Failure**: What if we fail publicly?

But here's the thing: **these fears are mostly in our heads**. Most people are too busy with their own projects to steal yours, and the benefits of transparency far outweigh the risks.

## What to Share

You don't need to share everything. Here's what works well:

- Progress updates and metrics
- Challenges you're facing and how you're solving them
- Lessons learned along the way
- Behind-the-scenes glimpses of your process

## Building Community

Building in public isn't just about broadcasting—it's about creating genuine connections. Respond to comments, ask for advice, and be generous with helping others on their journeys.

The goal isn't to go viral; it's to build a community of people who care about what you're creating and want to see you succeed.

## The Long Game

Building in public is a long-term strategy. The community you build today will be there to support your next project, and the next one after that. It's an investment in your future entrepreneurial endeavors.

Start sharing your journey today. The world needs to see what you're building.
