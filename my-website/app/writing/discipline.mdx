# Discipline

*June 15, 2025*

I didn’t really struggle with discipline in high school.

 was driven by a desire to be the best student. I had quite a few academic rivals, and they always kept me on my toes. My dad also promised me money for reaching certain academic milestones, which gave me an even greater drive to do well. 

Looking back, I don’t think there was ever a day that I didn’t study, regardless of whether I was sick, tired, or just didn’t feel like it. I still reviewed my notes. I loved the grind. I knew what I was working towards. 

Even in first year, as an international student paying ten times what domestic students pay, I was driven by pressure. There was no way I can repeat a course due to the sheer financial cost of it. I maintained a very high level of discipline all year long, and I didn’t let low scores or personal issues faze me, I just trucked on, and ended up getting into my program (at UofT you don’t get into your program until second year). 

I write this as someone who just finished second year, and struggled immensely with discipline. I had already made POSt. 
Then I realized that external factors had been driving me this whole time. In high school, I was driven by rewards, and a hunger for first place. 
In first year of uni, I was driven by pride and ego. I didn’t want to have to tell all my friends I transferred out of UofT because I didn’t get into my program. 

Now that I achieved what I wanted, what was there to fight for? I entered second year with an air of nonchalance when it came to school. I just didn’t care that much anymore. I couldn’t bring myself to study. I started skipping classes (even ones that took attendance), which bit me in the ass later (replace with more suitable sentence). 

What I have realized that to build immense discipline, you need a strong purpose. A good example is a woman that just found out that she’s pregnant with a child. Let’s say that this woman used to engage in chronic drinking and smoking. It is very likely that rationally, the woman would drop these habits for the sake of her child. Would she be able to drop these habits on a whim if she wasn’t with child? Maybe, but I’m certain it would be much harder. It is much easier to maintain discipline for long periods of time if you have a strong purpose. 

In high school, my desire to surpass my peers drove me. In first year, the prospect of having to transfer universities (and take a huge hit to my pride drove me). As a result, I was able to maintain a high level of discipline for a long amount of time. You need to have a strong purpose. 



I am not saying that you need to feel good or that discipline
