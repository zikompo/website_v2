        "I got into it because I recently started playing poker and wanted to understand the psychology behind making decisions when you have incomplete information.",

        "Great book for someone wanting to understand the emotional and psychological factors that drive our financial decisions. Talks a lot about how our upbringing and experiences shape the way we think about money.",
        "Has a lot of good anecdotes that make the book engaging, and it's an easy read.",
        "In a practical sense, Morgan Housel talks about how he approaches saving/investing, but it's not a how-to-book. I saw it more as an insightful book.",

        "Great book. It was very touching, and there were multiple moments where I had to pause and reflect to try and imagine going through the inhumane conditions that the author and others in the concentration camps had to endure.",
        "The book is about Viktor Frankl's experiences in the concentration camps during WW2 and how he found meaning in his life despite the horrors he endured. He also details methods for finding purpose, such as suffering with dignity.",

      review: [
        "This book is THE revenge tale, and probably one of the best books I've ever read.",
        "The story follows Edmond Dant√®s, a young sailor who is wrongfully imprisoned and seeks revenge on those who betrayed him.",
        "The way he goes about his retribution is both very clever and calculated, and despite being over 1200 pages long, it was a page-turner from start to finish. It has everything you could want in a book: adventure, romance, betrayal, and revenge.",
        "This was my first time reading a fiction book in a long time, and I think I will get back into reading more fiction after this.",

      review: [
        "Was a very interesting read, and rather empowering. This book follows the life of Tara, a woman who grew up in an extremely fundamentalist Mormon household, where she was denied access to education. It details how she gradually educates herself\
                and eventually goes on to earn a PhD from Cambridge University.",
        "The book is well-written and engaging. I got rather angry at some parts, especially when she detailed the abuse she and her siblings endured at the hands of their father/brother, and how her family refused to acknowledge it.\
                I even got more frustrated when she kept going back to her family despite the abuse, but I guess that's the power of family.",
        "It was inspiring overall, seeing someone overcome such adversity to attain such a high level of education. Overall a good read.",
